### What is interesting about this article?
<p>This article discusses the possibility of ChatGPT replacing Google's search engine. It's something that I never thought about, but after reading this article I can definitely see that ChatGPT could be a viable (and in some cases, even better) alternative of Google, with a few changes. I'm interested to see how Google will respond to ChatGPT and if they will be able to compete and maintain their position in this field. It's also pretty funny that ChatGPT itself says that it's not intended to replcae Google's search engine. I guess we'll see in the coming years what will happen, but as someone who aspires to work at Google in the future, I am personally hoping for Google to come up with something even more amazing than the already revolutionary ChatGPT.
